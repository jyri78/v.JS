# [Vanilla JavaScript](https://github.com/jyri78/v.JS)

Simple plain Javascript `class` with a set of functions.

*Warning!* This project is under early development stage.

## Usage

Include `v.JS` into HTML file and call `register()`:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- ... -->
    <script src="script/v.js"></script>
    <script>VJS.register()</script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- ... -->
</body>
</html>
```

And you are ready to use functions.
